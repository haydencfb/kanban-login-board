  ## This fullstack project has a seeded database that allows users to log in and access seeded ToDos, in progess, and completed Items. Additionally, new items can be created, as well as old ones be edited to desired liking. 

  - My motivation for this project was to learn how JWT works in a production setting and to see how it is used to send tokens across client and server renders.
  - I built this project to learn more about JWT and its use in a fullstack react app.
  - This program solves the problem of not having the ability to have one place to organize to do items.
  - I learned more about the JWT package, how it works, how its formatted, and the overall efficacy of its use.
